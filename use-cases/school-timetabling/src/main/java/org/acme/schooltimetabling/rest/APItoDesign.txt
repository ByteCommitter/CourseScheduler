#Second Task:

1. CSV containing two columns
	a. faculty_course_section
	b. number of hours needed per week
2. number of rooms (integer for now)
3. number of slots


API output -
CSV file containing a schedule
Columns in the schedule CSV

room_number (int), slot_number (int), faculty_course_section, day_of_the_week (int)



Third Task:
Add another parameter to the csv file taking the number of combined_slots_per_day
Is it possible for the course to take up more than two three slot a day despite having 
a given combined_slots_per_day =one slot a day?


Given sample input of csv:

faculty_course_section,hours_per_week,combined_slots_per_day
MATH_101_A,3,1
PHY_201_B,4,1
CS_372_A,4,2
